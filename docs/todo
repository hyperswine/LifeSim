implement a testing framework
change to qtensors and ctensors
change to doubles for complex field

##
Nov. 24th -> GET A COMPLEX ALGORITHM DONE! Then talk about it in overleaf and take pictures of your own libraries as some good context
Talk about invalid ops and exceptions in paper


##
Before submitting, subclass cmatrix and qmatrix from 'tmatrix' to prevent too much repeated code -> though I think we have to implement them separately like this anyway
Its simply to make it look less repetitive.


## Conclusion:
    Things to do: Make program more polymorphic and utilize OOP practices for better extendability and less repetitiveness
                  Implement a frontend based on opengl from scratch, to visualize molecules
                  Have an option to write everything to file and make it work on VMD
